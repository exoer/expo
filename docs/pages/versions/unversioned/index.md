title: What is Expo?

import Video from '../../../components/plugins/Video'

Welcome to the documentation for [Expo](http://expo.io) -- a set of tools and services for building, deploying, and quickly iterating on native iOS, Android, and web apps from the same codebase. The tools we provide are the Expo client app, CLI, SDK, and Snack. The services are build, update, and notify.

There are two ways to build a project with the tools Expo provides, and we call these workflows: you can use the "managed" workflow or the "bare" workflow. With the "managed" workflow, you only write JavaScript (or TypeScript) and lean on the [SDK](sdk/overview/) to give you access to your device capabilities and several services to handle the heavy lifting of building your app binary, uploading it to the store, and sending push notifications, all without you touching Xcode or Android Studio. With the "bare" workflow, we also speed up and improve your vanilla React Native development experience with the [SDK](sdk/overview/) and more.
